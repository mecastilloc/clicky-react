# clicky-react
A memory game with React.

## Overview
* The application renders 12 different images of NFL's Teams to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

* The application keeps track of the user's score and has a Max score for each round (meaning page load). The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's wins if selects the twelve teams just once and loses if a team is selected twice.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

* After a Win or Lose, the game restarts, the Max score is not reset until a page re-load.
